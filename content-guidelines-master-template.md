Your extension’s name is critical. It shows up everywhere—in search results, on [addons.mozilla.org](http://firefox.com "addons.mozilla.org"), and in the browser itself. It’s sometimes one of the few pieces of information that a user has to determine whether or not they are interested in what you built. 

Research shows that people really do take an extension’s name into account when making installation decisions. And, what you put into the extension name field becomes your URL on [addons.mozilla.org](http://firefox.com "addons.mozilla.org").

Between your extension name and subtitle, you have up to 70 characters to use—that’s because 70 is the max character limit for your headline in external search results. It’s best to keep your extension name shorter so you have more characters left over for your subtitle.

* Tincidunt lobortis feugiat vivamus at augue eget arcu dictum. Enim facilisis gravida neque convallis a cras.	
* Id diam vel quam elementum pulvinar etiam non. Quam id leo in vitae turpis.

## Extension Name Do’s and Don’ts

Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

<!-- Do this -->
<section class="do-this" markdown="1">
<header><h5>Do This</h5></header>

1. __Make it memorable__
2. __Make it unique__
3. __Keep it short for better display on smaller screens__
4. __Make it easy to read and say__
5. __Give an idea or hint about what your extension does with an illustrative word or metaphor__

<!-- Example -->
<div class="example" markdown="1">

Examples:  
An extension that saves passwords is called __Remembear__

An extension that puts a cat on new tabs is called __Tabbycat__

An extension that improves YouTube is called __Enhancer for YouTube__

</div>
<!-- END: Example -->

</section>
<!-- END: Do this -->

<!-- Not this -->
<section class="not-this" markdown="1">
<header><h5>Not This</h5></header>

1. __Don't include a description.__ 

 Save these details for your subtitle and description.

<!-- Inline Example -->
<span class="example" markdown="1">Example: Videomix, a fast video downloader</span>
<!-- END: Inline Example -->

2. __Don't stuff it with keywords.__ 

 Google is smarter than this and it just makes your extension look untrustworthy.

<!-- Inline Example -->
<span class="example" markdown="1">Example: Youtube Download Videos, Convert, Media, MP3, MP4, Free.</span>
<!-- END: Inline Example -->

3. __Don't use random words to differentiate, like “Barbara Notetaker.”__ 

 Instead, create a descriptive name that is not already in use, like “Instant Notetaker.”

4. __Don't call it something with no meaning, like “hoyv.”__ 

 While the name “hoyv” doesn’t work, the name “uBlock Origin” for an ad-blocking extension does because it contains the word “block”.

5. __Don't include "WebExtension," “Firefox” or “Mozilla."__

6. __Don't include version number or a previous name.__

<!-- Inline Example -->
<span class="example" markdown="1">Example: Weatherchanger (fix version)</span>
<!-- END: Example -->

7. __Don't make it hard to read or say.__

<!-- Inline Example -->
<span class="example" markdown="1">Example: TrLrs! Tab Changer.</span>
<!-- END: Inline Example -->

## Stuck? Try this.

#### 1. Identify the problem 

What problem does your extension solve? You had a reason for creating that extension...what was it? Write that down.

Take the popular extension, Remembear, as an example. You can imagine the creator of this extension writing, "I am tired of having to remember all of my passwords for the web. And I worry that these passwords will get stolen. I want a simple way to save and secure my passwords so they are always at my fingertips. And I don’t want the experience to be an unpleasant, security-laden process. Let’s make it friendly and easy.

#### 2. Identify key words

Pull out the key words (nouns, adjectives, verbs) and phrases from your description  and create a word list. Add other words that come to mind based on those words, including synonyms.

Remembear Example:

* Tired
* Remember
* Passwords
* Worry
* Stolen
* Simple
* Save
* Secure
* At your fingertips
* Friendly
* Easy

3. Example Lorum Ipsum

Pull out the key words (nouns, adjectives, verbs) and phrases from your description  and create a word list. Add other words that come to mind based on those words, including synonyms.

Remembear: dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur lemera dosada peel.
